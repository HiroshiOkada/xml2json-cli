# Vulnerability Assessment and Mitigation Plan

## Goal

Address dependency vulnerabilities in the `xml2json-cli` project, specifically focusing on the `xml2js` dependency.

## Plan

1.  **Identify `xml2js` Vulnerabilities:** Research known vulnerabilities for the `xml2js` library, specifically version `^0.6.2`. Use online resources like the npm website, vulnerability databases, and security advisories.
2.  **Update `xml2js`:** If vulnerabilities are found, attempt to update the `xml2js` dependency to the latest version.
3.  **Test the Application:** After updating the dependency, run the existing tests (`./test/test.sh`) to ensure that the application still functions correctly.
4.  **Implement Additional Tests:** If necessary, implement additional tests to specifically target the identified vulnerabilities and ensure that they are resolved by the update.
5.  **Consider Alternatives:** If updating `xml2js` is not feasible or does not resolve the vulnerabilities, consider alternative XML to JSON conversion libraries.
